Create documentation in the form of a HowTo/FAQ answer
instructing a user on the process of securely erasing their hard
drive using DBAN (http://sourceforge.net/projects/dban/).

This can be in a PDF, html page, or other suitable static
format of your choice.  To save time, don't worry about
making pictures, just put brief descriptive text of what the
picture would show.  [person's hand with finger pointing to
this paragraph]

This is to get a sense of your communication skills.  If you
have an existing FAQ or HowTo that you have written which
conveys a technical operation to an end user, please feel
free to put that in here instead.


Side note:  Georgia Tech does not securely wipe hard drives,
we physically destroy them in a scary looking metal shredder.
