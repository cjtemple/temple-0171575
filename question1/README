In the language of your choice, write code that prints out
the mean or mode of the contents of the files in data/.

Feel free to use any resources which would be available in a
typical office environment (docs, websites, books, etc.), but
please work on your own.  Consulting a rubber duck is of course
always OK.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging


Additional (optional) details:
------------------------------------------

- This is a short and minimal exercise in typical sysadmin
  duct tape fashion.  Do not worry about test cases, in line
  help, documentation, etc..  Focus on a quick solution to
  the core problem, it does not need to be elegant.

- You decide on whether to solve mean or mode, no need to do
  both.  The choice is offered since mean is easier in some
  languages and mode in others.

- Files in data/ contain one or more space separated
  rational numbers in decimal format.  The data may change,
  but you can rely on the format.

- For the purpose of this exercise, it can be assumed the
  files originate from a trusted data stream and are not
  actively malicious.  Really, no tricks, it is a basic data
  munging exercise.

- Pick any language.  Examples of options follow, but please
  don't feel restricted to this.
    shell: bash, zsh, tcsh, ksh, PowerShell, ...
    interpreted/compiled: python, perl, php, ruby, C, C++, Java, fortran, befunge, whitespace, ...

  Note: I don't recommend choosing befunge, but if that is what
  you think best, go for it.  (For that matter, scheme is not
  recommended either (but that is because of a (personal)
  preference against many (nested) parenthesis() ).)
  Really, any language except pseudo-code.

- An example outputs for the files currently in data/.

    $ ./solution
    mean: 2.5
    mode: 1

  This shows both mean and mode only so you have the
  correct values for the current files.  Pick one.
